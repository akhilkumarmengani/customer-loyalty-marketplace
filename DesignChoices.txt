Design Choices:

Based on the project description, we identified the following entities:
1. Employees
2. Customers
3. Brands
4. Activities
5. Reward Categories
6. Loyalty Programs
7. Customer Wallet

For the above entities, we created different relationships/ aggregations/ is-a relations.

Design Justification:

Admin Design:
1. Admin creates different brands, customers, loyalty Programs types, activities, and rewards.
   To achieve that,
   we created BRANDS, CUSTOMERS, ACTIVITIES, REWARD_CATEGORIES and LOYALTY_PROGRAMS Tables.
   So whenever admin creates new items, data is inserted into the above tables.


Brand Design:
1. Once the admin creates the brands, brands can create their own loyalty programs.
   This data is stored in REGULAR_LOYALTY_PROGRAMS / TIERED_LOYALTY_PROGRAMS.

2. Brand add different activities and rewards for the loyalty programs.
   This data is stored in 'BRANDS_LOYALTY_PROGRAMS_TO_ACTIVITIES', 'BRANDS_LOYALTY_PROGRAMS_TO_REWARDS'

Customer Design:

1. Customer enrolls in a Loyalty Program and perform different activities and earn points.
   This data is stored in this table CUSTOMERS_TO_BLP_ACTIVITIES, CUSTOMERS_TO_BLP_REWARDS

2. Total points for each loyalty program is stored.
   This data is stored in CUSTOMER_WALLET_TO_CUSTOMERS_BRANDS.
